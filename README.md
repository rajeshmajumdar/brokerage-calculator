# Samco Brokerage Calculator

Basically wrote it for personal use, instead of checking there website after every trade. I decided to write a small python script to calculate.

### Usage
```bash
$ python3 calc.py -h
Usage: calc.py [-h] [-i [INTRADAY ...]] [-d [DELIVERY ...]] [-c [CASHPLUS ...]] [-o [OPTIONS...]]

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -i [INTRADAY ...], --intraday [INTRADAY ...]
                          For equities intraday.
    -d [DELIVERY ...], --delivery [DELIVERY ...]
                          For equities delivery.
    -c [CASHPLUS ...], --cashplus [CASHPLUS ...]
                          For cashplus delivery.
    -o [OPTIONS ...], --options [OPTIONS ...]
                          For options intraday/delivery.
```

For further usage help, you can execute the program with desired argument.
